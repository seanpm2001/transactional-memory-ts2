This came from <https://github.com/fraggamuffin/tm_ts2021> which was the repository for
the C++ Technical Specification "Trannsactional Memory TS 2021" for N4906, the TM-TS2 from 2022-02-14:
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/n4906.pdf
It was moved here on Oct 10, 2022 where it will be edited for the DTS ballot comments from P2617
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2617r0.html

The draft Technical Specification is found in the `src` directory and is
written in LaTeX. There is a Makefile that can be used to compile the
sources, or you can use the `latexmk` program e.g. `latexmk -pdf ts`
will generate a PDF.
